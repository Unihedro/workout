**What's this?**

It's my code dump for my scripts to solve [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) 2018! I usually don't keep throwaway scripts around, but last year I did this and some people messaged me with questions, it amazes me that anyone even reads my code, but maybe you'll be able to get something out of it?

Most of my scripts are done in Ruby. Run them with `ruby file input` or `ruby -x file input`!

**Why are you doing this?**

I have been doing advent of code every year since it started (2015) and every year is lots of fun! Last year I felt competent enough to try to complete the whole course - I didn't (failed to do one problem so I stole some code from the megathread. It taught me a lot though!). I also make an effort to post and discuss my thoughts on the daily(?) subreddit megathread over at r/adventofcode - If I'm late at adding my code here, it might be there instead.

This year I have stuff to do on some days and I'm not sure if I'll be home in time to play, so I might be late on some days! I don't anticipate being able to land on the final global leaderboards, but let's see!

You can join me there or add me on Discord, where I am most active at!

**Why is your code so unreadable?** (many sources)

It's a throwaway script, I use it to solve the problem, minimize the distance from source input to solution (I don't mind taking shortcuts through manual work if it means avoiding code) and throw it away. I try to be in time for every opening hour for the stars, it is a narrow time window and a lot of pressure to work over. Please don't treat these as "my program to solve day X of advent of code", but "the battlefield in which I fought to overcome odds on many levels". I don't comment my code because I don't have the luxury to understand what I'm doing. I rarely change things after I'm done.

**Do you ever find that this poor coding style comes back to bite you in non-trivial questions? I can imagine being 30 mins into some difficult tree traversal problem and forgetting what s meant** [(src)](https://chat.stackoverflow.com/transcript/6?m=40293215#40293215)

I don't code poorly when I need to not code poorly. When I'm in a competitive environment, I'm using the battlefield logic: Hope that what I need will arrive and give clear signal. For example, if I need to build a search that I might need to tweak, I won't pack it tightly into many lines.  
If I need to find the function, it shouldn't be 1-char.  
If I don't need to find it however, it's fair game. get in get out go back if we absolutely must!
