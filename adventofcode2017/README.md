**What's this?**

It's my code dump for my scripts to solve Advent of Code 2017! I usually don't keep throwaway scripts around, but there's a wiki for me to add my repo to, so maybe you'll be able to get something out of it?

Most of my scripts are done in Ruby.

**Why are you doing this?**

I have been doing advent of code every year since it started (2015) and this is the first year that I feel competent enough to try to survive the whole course. I also make an effort to post and discuss my thoughts on the daily(?) subreddit megathread over at r/adventofcode - If I'm late at adding my code here, it might be there instead. You can join me there or add me on Discord, where I am most active at!

**Why is your code so unreadable?**

It's a throwaway script, I use it to solve the problem, minimize the distance from source input to solution (I don't mind taking shortcuts through manual work if it means avoiding code) and throw it away. I try to be in time for every opening hour for the stars, it is a narrow time window and a lot of pressure to work over. Please don't treat these as "my program to solve day X of advent of code", but "the battlefield in which I fought to overcome odds on many levels". I don't comment my code because I don't have the luxury to understand what I'm doing. I rarely change things after I'm done.
